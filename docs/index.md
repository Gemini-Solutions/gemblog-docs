## Would you like to be part of it?

I am going to start putting everything major I stumbled across in last couple of years and got me excited on how amazing people are doing even more amazing things. The objective of these blogs is to deep dive and see how everything fits.If you want to be part of it, you can subscribe to everything being posted in here, help review the docs, contribute or if you have anything in mind do share and we can collaborate.
